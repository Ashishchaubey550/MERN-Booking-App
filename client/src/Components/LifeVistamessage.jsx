        <p className='text-[13px] text-white font-[400] leading-[20px] my-3'>Plain and simple, we know what you are going through. We started out as vacation rental owners and fell in love with this business! <br /> We feel there is a pure model of advertising a rental that has been lost when the greedy mega site conglomerates attempted to take over the industry and your business. There is one thing that they forgot, we own the homes. <br/>Our vision for this website is to have as many vacation rental properties in this region listed here so it becomes the number one source for this part of the country. We can do this together, there is strength in numbers. The more properties from your community that list with us, the better it is for you and all of us.</p>
        <span className='text-[14px] text-white font-[600] leading-[20px]'>Sincerely</span>
